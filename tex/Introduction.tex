This chapter talks about motivation and applications of my work, and reviews previous research in the field.

\section{Motivations}
\label{sec:motivations}

Previous research in the field of X has established that method A is very useful \cite{Fisher:1954,Robbins:1951aa,Knight:1921}.
Another branch of researchers have figured out that method B could be better in certain occasions \cite{Wright:1921aa,Caratheodory:1909aa,Gibbs:1902,Clausius:1857}.
Here I propose a new method that gives results better than both types.
